It contains Lua Scripts which enables IVR Applications ( Baang, Sawaal and Polly ) Master code script to handle incoming\\outgoing calls. \nMaster code script hosted on local XAMP server.   IVR Applications connects to the FreeSWITCH server on the port 8021 (TCP Socket Connection, pass=  'Conakry2014' ) and sends api commands invoking relevant lua scripts, which render and respond back appropiately to application.    Freeswitch extensions invoke lua scripts that in turn invoke the master code script, for event notification and call control intiation according to different IVR application. For example. FreeSWITCH notify Baang IVR application using  IncomingHook.lua , when Baang User make an inbound call.   Using Socket Connections, IVR Applications can  :     check status    isActive.lua    make outbound calls, for Polly   call.lua  , for Baang  call_baang.lua  , for PQuiz   call_pquiz.lua  , for Rahemaa   call_rem.lua    answer incoming calls    answer.lua  hang up a call    hangup.lua  reject a call    reject.lua    record user voice    record.lua  play sound files    ask.lua    play with gather input    askGather.lua .",
